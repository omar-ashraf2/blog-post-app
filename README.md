#Blog Post with React

This is a website for a responsive blog post built using React.js. It has several features that allow users to interact with the website by posting their thoughts and commenting on other posts. Additionally, they can edit or delete any post they create.

To make it easier to save data, I used the local storage since this project does not have a database. The website initially opens with default posts fetched from a JSON file and then stored in local storage.

To test the website's functionality, you can try editing or removing any of the default posts. There are still some glitches that require fixing when removing a manually created post.

I used React Router in the App.js file to create a route for each of the three main pages - Home, Write a Post, and Single Post. The Home page contains all of the posts, the Write a Post page allows users to create their posts, and the Single Post page contains all the post components to enable users to interact with them.
